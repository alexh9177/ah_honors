The contents here contain the raw and polished python, Jupyter Notebook, and bash code used for the defense of my latin 
honors thesis at the University of Colorado Boulder, defended October 28, 2022. 

Bioinformatic programs used (EX. guppy, samtools, stringtie, salmon) were run from the command line. Programs were symlinked to the 
bashrc profile of the local machine in my PI's lab. 

All contents are property of Alex Hirano and the University of Colorado, Boulder.
